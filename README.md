## About the Project

This is a mobile application made in React Native App. It consume an public API about cocktails and renders it on screen. Search input while you type.
See photo and the name of the drink you are searching for.

### Libraries
* React Native: Same code base, two different platforms!
* TypeScript: Project it is running in Typescript.
* React Naviagtion: Naviagtion it is a must when you need to navigate between screens.
* Redux: Awesome tool for complex state management. Used on this app as example what Redux can do.
* Redux Saga: Since we need to make external calls, a midlleware it is a must. I chosed this one because was the last one I worked with. But there are pleny of greate choices out there.
* Axios: I like to use Axios to make external API calls, since it is clean and easy to use;
